# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Mall-Customers-Dataset-
This project focuses on Customer Segmentation using the famous Mall Customers Dataset from Kaggle.
The goal is to group mall customers into distinct clusters based on their Annual Income and Spending Score, so businesses can better understand customer behavior and target marketing strategies effectively.

We applied Unsupervised Learning (Clustering) techniques:

Data Preprocessing & Scaling

K-Means Clustering (with Elbow Method to find optimal k)

Visualization of clusters in 2D space

Bonus: DBSCAN clustering for comparison

Cluster Analysis (average spending per cluster)

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is Mall Customer Dataset (from Kaggle).
It contains 200 entries with the following key features:

CustomerID – Unique ID of the customer

Gender – Male/Female

Age – Customer’s age

Annual Income (k$) – Annual income in $1000s

Spending Score (1-100) – Score assigned based on behavior and spending nature
